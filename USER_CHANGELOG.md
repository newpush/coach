Hey Coach Watts Community!

We're thrilled to launch v0.5.3, focused entirely on streamlining your workflow and giving you better insights into your fitness. This update includes a major integration many of you have been waiting for!

Here are the highlights of what’s new:

---

## 🚀 Seamless Intervals.icu Integration

For athletes and coaches who rely on Intervals.icu for tracking and analysis, your workflow just became *much* easier!

*   **One-Click Publishing:** You can now publish your planned workouts from Coach Watts directly onto your Intervals.icu calendar with a single button press on the plan dashboard. No more manual exports or data entry!
*   **Optimized Format:** We handle all the technical conversions to ensure your structured workouts display perfectly inside Intervals.icu.

## 📈 Enhanced Performance Metrics

Get a clearer picture of your physical status right inside your athlete profile.

*   **Training Load & Form:** Your Athlete Profile now features essential training metrics (often referred to as CTL/ATL/TSB) that show your current **Training Load** (Fitness) and **Form** (Freshness/Fatigue). Use these visual cues to train smarter, not just harder!

## 📢 Stay Up-to-Date

We want to make sure you never miss out on new features or critical updates.

*   **New Release Notifications:** We’ve added a prominent notification system to the dashboard header. When we release a new version, you’ll see the latest notes immediately, so you always know what improvements we’ve rolled out!

# 🎉 Coach Watts v0.5.2 is Live! More Precision, More Control

We’re excited to roll out v0.5.2, focusing on bringing a key performance metric to your profile and giving you greater control over your automatic settings. Update your app now to check out the improvements!

## ❤️ New Performance Metrics

### **Track Your Lactate Threshold Heart Rate (LTHR)**
You asked, and we delivered! You can now input and track your **Lactate Threshold Heart Rate (LTHR)** directly in your Profile Settings. 

This crucial metric allows Coach Watts to calculate your personalized heart rate training zones with much greater accuracy, helping you dial in your workouts for maximum benefit!

## 🧠 Smarter Profile Updates

### **You're in Control of Auto-Detection**
Coach Watts often uses your activity data to detect new performance benchmarks (like a change in FTP or Weight). We’ve made this process clearer and safer than ever:

*   **Confirmation Modal:** If we detect a potential update to your profile settings, you will now see a clear confirmation screen.
*   **Diff Detection:** This screen explicitly shows you *exactly* what the change is (e.g., "FTP changing from 250W to 255W") before you approve it.

This ensures you are always aware of, and in full control of, the settings Coach Watts uses for your training plans. ✅

## ⚙️ Stability & Chart Improvements

We’ve ironed out a couple of technical kinks to ensure a smoother experience:

*   **Accurate Charts:** We fixed an issue where some performance charts (like the CTL/ATL/TSB graph) occasionally tried to calculate or display data far into the future unnecessarily. Your charts now reflect current and relevant performance data more reliably.
*   **Snappier Data:** General optimizations to how we fetch interval data mean quicker loading times and a more responsive app experience. 🚀

# 🚀 Coach Watts v0.5.1 is Here! Faster, Cleaner, and More Reliable 📈

We’ve just rolled out a fresh update focused on providing a smoother planning experience and ensuring your training data is perfectly accurate.

Here is what's new for our athletes and coaches:

---

### ✨ New Planning & Interface Features

We’ve added powerful tools to help you manage and understand your training plans at a glance:

*   **Deep Dive into Plans 🔎**
    Viewing long, complex training plans is now much easier! We introduced a new detail viewer with smooth **pagination and a fullscreen modal**, making it simple to scroll through every session.
*   **Plan Statistics at Your Fingertips**
    When viewing your list of training plans, you can now see quick statistics (like total duration or anticipated stress load) right away. This makes plan selection and comparison much faster for coaches.
*   **Instant Access to Chat 💬**
    We added a prominent **Chat Button to the dashboard header**, giving you faster access to support or coach messaging. Plus, we tidied up the layout to look even better on your phone!
*   **Fresh Start Option 🗑️**
    Need to completely reset your training history and start data collection over? You now have the option within the UI to **wipe your profile data**, giving you total control over your coaching journey.

---

### ✅ Reliability & Data Accuracy Fixes

We took a deep dive into the engine room to squash some bugs that were throwing off training load calculations and data reporting. Your metrics are now more trustworthy than ever!

*   **No More Duplicate Workouts! 🚫**
    We fixed an issue that occasionally created duplicate planned activities, which could artificially inflate your scheduled training stress. Your calendar will now stay clean, and your stress calculations (like CTL) will be spot on.
*   **Clearer Weekly Summaries**
    Your weekly summary dashboards now cleanly **separate completed activities from planned activities**. You get an accurate view of what you actually accomplished versus what the schedule called for.
*   **Metrics You Can Trust 🎯**
    We implemented smarter filtering to ensure that any stray or duplicate workouts are completely ignored when calculating your overall training metrics. Get back to trusting your Chronic Training Load (CTL) and Form (TSB)!
