# Release v0.5.2

# 🎉 Coach Watts v0.5.2 is Live! More Precision, More Control

We’re excited to roll out v0.5.2, focusing on bringing a key performance metric to your profile and giving you greater control over your automatic settings. Update your app now to check out the improvements!

## ❤️ New Performance Metrics

### **Track Your Lactate Threshold Heart Rate (LTHR)**

You asked, and we delivered! You can now input and track your **Lactate Threshold Heart Rate (LTHR)** directly in your Profile Settings.

This crucial metric allows Coach Watts to calculate your personalized heart rate training zones with much greater accuracy, helping you dial in your workouts for maximum benefit!

## 🧠 Smarter Profile Updates

### **You're in Control of Auto-Detection**

Coach Watts often uses your activity data to detect new performance benchmarks (like a change in FTP or Weight). We’ve made this process clearer and safer than ever:

- **Confirmation Modal:** If we detect a potential update to your profile settings, you will now see a clear confirmation screen.
- **Diff Detection:** This screen explicitly shows you _exactly_ what the change is (e.g., "FTP changing from 250W to 255W") before you approve it.

This ensures you are always aware of, and in full control of, the settings Coach Watts uses for your training plans. ✅

## ⚙️ Stability & Chart Improvements

We’ve ironed out a couple of technical kinks to ensure a smoother experience:

- **Accurate Charts:** We fixed an issue where some performance charts (like the CTL/ATL/TSB graph) occasionally tried to calculate or display data far into the future unnecessarily. Your charts now reflect current and relevant performance data more reliably.
- **Snappier Data:** General optimizations to how we fetch interval data mean quicker loading times and a more responsive app experience. 🚀

Happy Cycling!
