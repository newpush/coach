# 🚴‍♂️ What’s New in Coach Watts v0.5.17

Hello, Team! We’ve been busy under the hood making Coach Watts faster, smarter, and more connected. This update brings major upgrades to your AI coaching experience and expands how you sync your data.

Here is the breakdown of what’s new in v0.5.17:

### 🧠 A Smarter AI Coach

We’ve upgraded the "brain" of Coach Watts to give you more accurate and personalized training advice.

- **Upgraded AI Models:** We are now using the latest **Gemini 3.0** technology for faster and more insightful workout analysis.
- **Better Context:** The AI now understands your specific injury status and your preferred training metrics (like whether you prefer Power or Heart Rate) to give you better advice.
- **Automatic Check-ins:** The AI can now automatically generate daily check-ins based on your wellness data, helping you stay on top of your recovery.
- **Feedback & Reporting:** Notice a weird AI response? You can now use the new **AI Feedback Form** to help us keep improving your coaching experience.

### 🔗 More Ways to Connect

We want your data to flow seamlessly into Coach Watts, no matter what devices you use.

- **Polar Integration is Here!** You can now fully sync your Polar activities and data directly into the platform. ⌚
- **Enhanced Intervals.icu Sync:** We’ve improved how planned workouts sync back and forth, including a new "Readiness Scale" to help align your training load with how you actually feel.
- **Bulk FIT Uploads:** Got a backlog of files? You can now upload multiple FIT files at once for background processing. 📂

### 📈 Deeper Wellness Tracking

Your health off the bike is just as important as your power on it.

- **New Health Metrics:** You can now track your **Weight** and **Blood Pressure** directly within the app.
- **Clearer Wellness Labels:** Instead of just numbers, you’ll now see descriptive labels for things like **Mood, Stress, Hydration, and Injury status** so you can understand your data at a glance. 💧
- **Auto-Analysis:** Coach Watts now automatically analyzes your nutrition and readiness data as soon as it arrives, giving you instant feedback.

### 📱 Improved Experience & Dashboard

We’ve refined the look and feel of the app to make it easier to use on the go.

- **Mobile-Optimized Dashboard:** Your recent activities and upcoming workouts now look better and are easier to read on your phone. 📱
- **Chat Sharing:** Find a great insight in your AI chat? You can now share chat rooms with others.
- **Better Calendars:** We’ve fixed those pesky timezone bugs! Your workouts and events will now always show up at the correct time, no matter where you are in the world. 🌍

### 🛠️ Small but Mighty Fixes

- **Smart Sync:** Improved logic to ensure completed workouts don't get accidentally deleted or overwritten during sync.
- **Goal Tracking:** Your training goals now automatically update when you change your weight or FTP.
- **Flexible Profiles:** You can now leave certain profile fields (like nickname or sex) optional for more privacy.
