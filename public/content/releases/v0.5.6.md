# Coach Watts App Update: v0.5.6 is Live! 🚀

Hello athletes and coaches! We've just pushed a major update focused on powerful new data connections, stability, and a polished look.

Here’s what’s new in v0.5.6:

## 🔗 Seamless Data Integration: Intervals.icu is Here!

The biggest news is the full integration with **Intervals.icu**!

- **New Connection:** You can now connect your Coach Watts account directly with Intervals.icu using OAuth for secure and seamless data sharing.
- **Rock-Solid Stability:** We have made significant improvements to ensure your connection remains reliable. If Intervals.icu is busy, our system is now smart enough to automatically retry syncing your data later without errors.
- **Clean Disconnects:** If you ever need to unlink your account, the disconnection process is now instant and complete.

## 🛠 Reliability & Usability Upgrades

We’ve fine-tuned several areas to make your daily experience faster and smoother:

- **Instant Activity Sync:** The **Refresh button** on your Activities page now reliably forces a data sync with your connected apps, ensuring you see the latest workout results immediately.
- **Improved Heart Rate Data:** We standardized how heart rate data is handled across the dashboard and API for complete consistency.
- **New Connected App Logos:** Head over to the Connected Apps settings to see slick new logos for **Strava, WHOOP, Hevy**, and others, making navigation cleaner and easier!

## ✨ Polished Look & Transparency

We've focused on making the Coach Watts platform look even better:

- **Fresh Look:** You'll notice updated branding and logos throughout the sidebar and home page.
- **Changelog Page:** Want to know what's new anytime? We've added a dedicated **Changelog page** within your Settings, so you can always review the latest app updates!
