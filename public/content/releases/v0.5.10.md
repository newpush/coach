## 🧠 Smarter Recovery & Training Load

Understanding your body's readiness is crucial for maximizing performance. We've introduced a suite of new tools to give you unparalleled insight:

- **Integrated Readiness Scores:** Your wellness checks now include a dedicated Readiness section! We pull these insights directly into the app so you know exactly when to push or rest. 🚦
- **New Training Load Insight Modal:** Quickly review your acute and chronic training load (ATL/CTL) trends right from your dashboard cards. This modal gives you a deeper dive into how your training is trending.
- **Data Freshness Alerts:** Never worry about using outdated metrics again! Your dashboard now features **stale data warnings** and prompts to auto-update, ensuring your coaching advice is always based on the latest activities. 🔄

## ✨ Performance & Reliability Upgrades

We've optimized several key areas of the app for speed and stability:

- **Lightning-Fast Workout Lists:** We've refactored how we load your training history. Workouts lists now use server-side pagination, meaning they load significantly faster, especially for long-term users. 💨
- **Better Data Handling:** We’ve resolved a few backend issues to ensure absolute consistency:
  - Timezone handling is now rock-solid, ensuring your workout calendar dates are always correct regardless of where you are.
  - We fixed an issue with how Kilojoules (energy expenditure) were stored, ensuring 100% accurate training data metrics.
- **Automatic Error Recovery:** If you experience a rare loading hiccup, the app is now smarter and will attempt an automatic page reload, keeping your workflow smooth.

## 🎯 Enhanced Coaching Intelligence

Our AI Coach is getting smarter, offering more tailored and impactful advice:

- **Deeper Athlete Profile:** We now include metrics like your **Heart Rate/Power Alignment Score** and your **Active Goals** when generating your profile analysis. This means the AI better understands your physiological tendencies and long-term targets.
- **Prioritized Current Metrics:** The coaching model now prioritizes your most recent and important metrics, ensuring recommendations are highly relevant to your _current_ fitness state.
- **Improved Recommendation View:** We've polished the layout for workout recommendations and added a convenient history toggle so you can easily review past suggestions.

## 🎨 UI Polish & Clarity

- **Garmin Data Attribution:** We have implemented clear branding and attribution across the app. You'll see explicit indicators confirming when data has been synchronized and processed from providers like Garmin. Trust and clarity are paramount! ✅
- **Clean Layouts:** Fixed several layout issues on the Settings page and ensured planned workout descriptions preserve line breaks, making them much easier to read.
