## 🚀 Game-Changing New Features

### 🎯 Plan Adherence & Linking (Huge Upgrade!)

We know it can be tough to compare what you planned versus what you actually did. This release makes plan tracking seamless:

- **Plan Adherence Score (NEW!):** See a detailed score on your completed workout pages that instantly tells you how closely you followed the prescribed structure (duration, intensity, and structure). No more guessing!
- **Drag-and-Drop Linking:** Link your completed ride file directly to its corresponding planned workout slot using intuitive drag-and-drop on the calendar. 🔗
- **Enhanced Visibility:** Calendar and Quick View screens now clearly display the details of the planned workout linked to your activity, along with easy options to unlink or manage them.
- **Data Cleanup:** If you happen to upload a ride twice, you can now easily promote the best file as the primary workout, keeping your activity log clean.

### 💪 Smarter Training Analysis

- **Improved TSS Accuracy:** We have refined the underlying formulas used to estimate Training Stress Score (TSS) and overall workload, providing you with more precise and reliable training load data.
- **Expanded Training Zones:** Our analysis tools now support up to Z7 and Z8 (Training Peaks model), offering coaches and athletes better compatibility for advanced training methodologies.

## 💡 Quality of Life Improvements

- **Better Weekly Reports:** Your weekly summary reports now include detailed tracking data for your active goals, giving you a comprehensive view of your progress. 📈
- **Reliable Sharing:** We’ve overhauled the backend for sharing workouts, ensuring that your share links are more robust and reliable.
- **Integration Sync Control:** Syncing data from your devices is faster and smarter, with new controls for syncing specific date ranges.

## 🛠️ Stability & Bug Fixes

We took time to stabilize the application by addressing several technical debt items and squashing annoying bugs:

- **Smoother UI:** We fixed several visual glitches related to colors, badges, and button displays across the platform, especially within the workout modal and quick-view components.
- **Backend Stability:** General improvements were made to ensure a smoother, more reliable experience across the app. 🪲
