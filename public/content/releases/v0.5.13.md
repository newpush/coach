### 🚀 New Features & Plan Control

| Feature                              | Benefit                                                                                                                                                                      |
| :----------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Workout Chat Integration**         | Discuss specific planned workouts directly within the app! Get immediate context and insights for your upcoming sessions.                                                    |
| **Anchored Workouts**                | Gain more control over AI-generated plans. You can now "anchor" specific key workouts (like races or long rides) to prevent the system from moving them during plan updates. |
| **Independent Workout Management**   | Easily manage workouts that exist outside of a formal training plan, giving you more flexibility in scheduling.                                                              |
| **Mini Workout Structure Charts**    | See the structure of any workout at a glance on your calendar and activity lists—no need to click into the details first!                                                    |
| **Daily Check-in Notes**             | Added an input field to the Daily Check-in modal so you can log personal thoughts, context, or feelings for your coach or for later review.                                  |
| **Intervals.icu Integration Polish** | Enhanced profile auto-detection and smoother logic for linking/unlinking planned workouts, making your third-party sync experience seamless.                                 |
| **Easy Cleanup Tool**                | Added a new setting that allows you to quickly clear out all past planned workouts that you didn't complete.                                                                 |

### ⚙️ Performance & Stability Enhancements

We focused heavily on background task performance to make the app feel faster and more reliable:

- **Real-Time Status:** Plan generation, profile updates, and syncing now happen faster! You can see the real-time status of these critical background tasks across your dashboard and navigation bar.
- **Perfect Timing:** We implemented fixes for timezone handling to ensure your recommendations, scheduled tasks, and training plan dates are always generated accurately, regardless of your location.
- **Smarter Engine Chaining:** The processes that generate your profiles and recommendations now run more efficiently in sequence, meaning faster and more timely daily suggestions.

### ✨ Quality of Life Fixes

- **No More Duplicates:** We resolved an issue that sometimes caused workout descriptions and text to duplicate when syncing or publishing workouts to Intervals.icu.
- **Dashboard Improvements:** General cleanup and polish for the upcoming workouts list and recommendation cards, making your dashboard more informative.
- **Smoother Alerts:** System messages and alerts now look cleaner and dismiss reliably when you interact with them.
- General UI refinements across the app for better consistency and responsiveness.

We hope these updates help you train smarter and more efficiently! Happy cycling! 🚴‍♀️
