# Release v0.5.1

# 🚀 Coach Watts v0.5.1 is Here! Faster, Cleaner, and More Reliable 📈

We’ve just rolled out a fresh update focused on providing a smoother planning experience and ensuring your training data is perfectly accurate.

Here is what's new for our athletes and coaches:

---

### ✨ New Planning & Interface Features

We’ve added powerful tools to help you manage and understand your training plans at a glance:

- **Deep Dive into Plans 🔎**
  Viewing long, complex training plans is now much easier! We introduced a new detail viewer with smooth **pagination and a fullscreen modal**, making it simple to scroll through every session.
- **Plan Statistics at Your Fingertips**
  When viewing your list of training plans, you can now see quick statistics (like total duration or anticipated stress load) right away. This makes plan selection and comparison much faster for coaches.
- **Instant Access to Chat 💬**
  We added a prominent **Chat Button to the dashboard header**, giving you faster access to support or coach messaging. Plus, we tidied up the layout to look even better on your phone!
- **Fresh Start Option 🗑️**
  Need to completely reset your training history and start data collection over? You now have the option within the UI to **wipe your profile data**, giving you total control over your coaching journey.

### ✅ Reliability & Data Accuracy Fixes

We took a deep dive into the engine room to squash some bugs that were throwing off training load calculations and data reporting. Your metrics are now more trustworthy than ever!

- **No More Duplicate Workouts! 🚫**
  We fixed an issue that occasionally created duplicate planned activities, which could artificially inflate your scheduled training stress. Your calendar will now stay clean, and your stress calculations (like CTL) will be spot on.
- **Clearer Weekly Summaries**
  Your weekly summary dashboards now cleanly **separate completed activities from planned activities**. You get an accurate view of what you actually accomplished versus what the schedule called for.
- **Metrics You Can Trust 🎯**
  We implemented smarter filtering to ensure that any stray or duplicate workouts are completely ignored when calculating your overall training metrics. Get back to trusting your Chronic Training Load (CTL) and Form (TSB)!

Happy Cycling! 🚴‍♀️💨
