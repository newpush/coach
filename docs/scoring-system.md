## Using Scores for Progress Tracking

### Time-Based Queries

The scoring system enables powerful time-based analysis:

```sql
-- Track workout scores over time
SELECT date, overallScore, technicalScore, pacingScore
FROM "Workout"
WHERE userId = ? AND date >= ?
ORDER BY date;

-- Track nutrition trends
SELECT date, overallScore, macroBalanceScore, qualityScore
FROM "Nutrition"
WHERE userId = ? AND date >= ?
ORDER BY date;

-- Track weekly report scores
SELECT dateRangeStart, overallScore, trainingLoadScore, recoveryScore
FROM "Report"
WHERE userId = ? AND type = 'WEEKLY_ANALYSIS'
ORDER BY dateRangeStart;
```

### Identifying Trends

**Improving Areas**: Rising scores indicate successful adaptation and development
**Declining Areas**: Falling scores suggest fatigue, injury risk, or need for intervention
**Plateau Areas**: Stable scores may indicate maintenance or need for new stimulus

### Setting Goals

Use scores to set specific, measurable goals:
- "Improve average workout pacing score from 6 to 8"
- "Achieve consistency score of 9+ for 4 consecutive weeks"
- "Maintain nutrition quality score above 7"

### Visualizations

Scores enable powerful visualizations:
- Line charts showing score trends over time
- Radar charts comparing different score dimensions
- Heat maps showing score patterns
- Rolling averages to smooth day-to-day variation

## Score Calculation Principles

### AI-Generated Scores

All scores are generated by AI analysis using:
1. **Objective Metrics**: Hard data from workouts, nutrition, etc.
2. **Comparative Analysis**: Performance relative to goals and capabilities
3. **Context Awareness**: Training phase, recovery status, recent history
4. **Holistic Assessment**: Multiple factors synthesized into single score

### Consistency Standards

To ensure meaningful tracking over time:
- **Same Scale**: All scores use consistent 1-10 scale
- **Clear Guidelines**: Specific criteria for each score level
- **Realistic Ranges**: Scores reflect actual performance, not inflated
- **Contextual**: Adjusted for athlete level and circumstances
