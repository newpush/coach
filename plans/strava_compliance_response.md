# Strava API Application Description & Use Case

**Application Name:** Coach Watts

**Description:**
Coach Watts is a personal training companion application designed to help individual athletes analyze their fitness progress and training habits.

**Use Case:**
We use the Strava API to allow individual users to authenticate and import their own personal activity history (rides, runs, swims) and detailed metrics (power, heart rate, speed) into a private, secure dashboard. The imported data is used exclusively to:
1. Visualize the user's training history and fitness trends within their private account.
2. Generate automated, personalized coaching insights and recovery recommendations for that specific user.

**Compliance Statement:**
*   **Data Privacy:** Strava data is displayed and disclosed solely to the authenticated user who owns the data. We do not display or disclose one user's data to any other users or third parties.
*   **AI Usage:** Strava data is used strictly as context for generating individual user insights (inference). **We do not use Strava data for training artificial intelligence or machine learning models.**
*   **No Competition:** The application is a complementary tool for deep individual analysis and does not replicate Strava's social or segment functionality.
